# Archived Planning Documents

This directory contains detailed planning and design documents from the development process. These documents were valuable during implementation but have been superseded by the current architecture documentation.

## Archived Files

## Why Archived?

These documents served their purpose during the planning and implementation phases. They contain valuable historical context but are no longer the primary reference for the current system.

**Current Documentation:**
- **[CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](../CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - What's actually implemented (concise)
- **[PLAN.md](../PLAN.md)** - Development roadmap and next steps
- **[DATA_SCHEMA_COMPLETE.md](../DATA_SCHEMA_COMPLETE.md)** - Database schema v5

---

**Note:** These archived documents remain useful for understanding design decisions and architectural evolution, but should not be used as the primary reference for current implementation.
