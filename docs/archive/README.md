# Archived Planning & Completed Work Documents

This directory contains detailed design documents and completed work documentation from the development process. These documents are preserved for historical context and detailed reference.

## Archived Files

### Phase 2.5 Completion (Recently Archived - 2025-10-28)

#### ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS_V2_4.md
**Date:** October 2025
**Purpose:** Complete technical breakdown of dependency inversion refactoring
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - All 24 interfaces implemented and tested
**Key Results:**
- 302 tests passing (44 DAO tests, 24 entity serialization tests)
- Zero dependency inversion violations
- EventBroker refactored from singleton to Riverpod-managed
- Production-ready code with complete test isolation

**Read this if:** You need detailed before/after code examples of the dependency inversion refactor or want to understand the architectural decision-making process.

#### GROUP_BALANCES_PLAN_V2_5.md
**Date:** October 2025
**Purpose:** Balance calculation system architecture and implementation plan
**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - UI integration pending
**Key Results:**
- Core calculation logic fully implemented and tested (32 tests)
- Event-driven triggers working
- Reactive Riverpod providers ready for UI
- Only UI widgets remain (2-3 hours estimated)

**Read this if:** You need complete architecture of balance calculations or want to see the implementation details of the settlement optimization algorithm.

## When to Use Archived Documents

✅ **Use archived docs when:**
- You need complete technical details of a completed phase
- You're researching design decisions and architectural evolution
- You want to understand "why" something was built a certain way
- You need detailed code examples from implementation

❌ **Don't use archived docs for:**
- Current project status (use PLAN.md)
- Understanding current architecture (use CURRENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Database schema (use DATA_SCHEMA_COMPLETE.md)
- What to work on next (use PLAN.md)
