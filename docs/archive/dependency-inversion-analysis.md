# Dependency Inversion Analysis (COMPLETED)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All findings implemented
**Date:** 2025-10-24

This document identified 24 architectural gaps. All have been resolved.

## Status Summary

| Component | Count | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| DAO Interfaces | 5 | ✅ All implemented with 44 tests |
| Use Case Interfaces | 11 | ✅ All implemented with 13 test suites |
| Sync Service Interfaces | 3 | ✅ All implemented with 12 tests |
| Event System | 1 | ✅ Refactored from singleton to Riverpod |
| Repository Interfaces | 4 | ✅ Already existed |
| **Total** | **24** | **✅ COMPLETE** |

## Implementation Results

- **302 tests passing** (was 230 in previous phase)
- **44 new DAO tests** covering CRUD, soft delete, streams, sync upsert
- **24 entity serialization tests** for User, ExpenseShareEntity, GroupMemberEntity
- **Zero concrete dependencies** in presentation layer
- **Zero singleton anti-patterns** (EventBroker managed by Riverpod)

## Architecture Achieved

```
Presentation Layer (Riverpod providers)
    ↓ depends on interfaces only
Domain Layer (Use Cases, Entities)
    ↓ depends on interfaces
Data Layer (Repositories, DAOs, Sync Services)
```

**Result:** Complete test isolation - repositories testable without database, UI testable without repositories.
