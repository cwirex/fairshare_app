## Architecture Principles (v2.2)

### Clean Architecture Layers

**Domain Layer** (`lib/features/*/domain/`)
- Pure business logic (entities, repositories, use cases)
- No dependencies on infrastructure
- Repository interfaces only

**Data Layer** (`lib/features/*/data/`)
- Repository implementations
- DAOs and data sources
- Firestore services
- Handles sync and events

**Presentation Layer** (`lib/features/*/presentation/`)
- UI components (screens, widgets)
- State management (Riverpod providers)
- Calls Use Cases, never repositories directly

**Core Layer** (`lib/core/`)
- Shared utilities (events, logging, database)
- Cross-cutting concerns

### Error Handling Pattern

**Use Cases:**
- Handle ALL validation and error wrapping
- Return `Result<T>` (Success or Failure)
- Wrap repository calls in try-catch blocks
- Provide logging via inherited `LoggerMixin`

**Repositories:**
- Focus solely on data operations
- Throw exceptions directly (no Result wrapping)
- Fire events after successful operations
- Maintain atomic transactions

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Single Responsibility: Repositories do data, Use Cases handle business logic
- ‚úÖ Clean Interfaces: Simple return types, no Result wrapping in repos
- ‚úÖ Consistent Error Handling: All errors flow through Use Cases uniformly

### Event-Driven Architecture

**Events:**
- Fired by repositories after successful operations
- Broadcast via singleton `EventBroker`
- Used for reactive UI updates
- Fire for BOTH local and remote changes

**Providers:**
- Can react to events for real-time updates
- Multiple providers can listen to same events
- Event-driven state management

## Development Guidelines

### Standard Pattern for All Features

```dart
// 1. Create Use Case
class CreateFeatureUseCase extends UseCase<Input, Output> {
  final FeatureRepository _repository;

  CreateFeatureUseCase(this._repository);

  @override
  Future<Result<Output>> call(Input input) async {
    log.d('Creating feature: $input');

    // Validation
    if (input.isInvalid) {
      return Failure(Exception('Invalid input'));
    }

    // Execute and handle errors
    try {
      final result = await _repository.createFeature(input);
      return Success(result);
    } catch (e) {
      log.e('Error creating feature: $e');
      return Failure(Exception('Failed to create feature'));
    }
  }
}

// 2. Repository fires event
class SyncedFeatureRepository implements FeatureRepository {
  final AppDatabase _database;
  final EventBroker _eventBroker;

  @override
  Future<Output> createFeature(Input input) async {
    await _database.transaction(() async {
      await _database.featureDao.insert(input);
      await _database.syncDao.enqueueOperation(...);
    });

    _eventBroker.fire(FeatureCreated(result));
    return result; // Throws on error
  }
}

// 3. Provider calls Use Case
class FeatureNotifier extends _$FeatureNotifier {
  Future<void> createFeature(Input input) async {
    state = const AsyncLoading();

    final useCase = ref.read(createFeatureUseCaseProvider);
    final result = await useCase.call(input);

    result.fold(
      (_) => state = const AsyncData(null),
      (error) => state = AsyncError(error, StackTrace.current),
    );
  }
}
```

### Code Style
- ‚úÖ One class per file (SRP)
- ‚úÖ No barrel files (direct imports)
- ‚úÖ Extensions stay with base class
- ‚úÖ Concise comments (code should be self-documenting)
- ‚úÖ LoggerMixin for logging in Use Cases and Repositories
