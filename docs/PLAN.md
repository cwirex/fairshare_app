- ‚úÖ Result<T> pattern working correctly
- ‚úÖ Base UseCase pattern established
- ‚è≥ Unit tests pending

**Architecture Decision:** UI calls use cases directly (no ExpenseNotifier), handles Result<T> with .fold()

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 2.2: Repository Integration - COMPLETED (2025-10-14)

**Goal:** Integrate EventBroker into repositories and update implementations

**Tasks:**
- [x] **Update Repository Implementations**
  - [x] Inject `EventBroker` into `SyncedExpenseRepository`
  - [x] Inject `EventBroker` into `SyncedGroupRepository`
  - [x] Fire events after successful operations
  - [x] Maintain atomic transactions (DB + Queue + Events)
  - [x] Update repository providers

- [x] **Update DAOs**
  - [x] Pass `EventBroker` to DAO sync methods (clean Drift-compatible approach)
  - [x] Update `upsertExpenseFromSync()` to accept EventBroker parameter
  - [x] Update `upsertGroupFromSync()` to accept EventBroker parameter
  - [x] Update `upsertGroupMemberFromSync()` to accept EventBroker parameter

  - [x] Test files updated with EventBroker mocks

**Key Achievement:**
‚úÖ **Clean Architecture Maintained** - DAOs accept EventBroker as method parameters (not constructor), preserving Drift compatibility

**Pattern Implemented:**
```dart
// Repository fires events (local operations)
Future<ExpenseEntity> createExpense(ExpenseEntity expense) async {
  await _database.transaction(() async {
    await _database.expensesDao.insertExpense(expense);
    await _database.syncDao.enqueueOperation(...);
  });
  _eventBroker.fire(ExpenseCreated(expense)); ‚úÖ
  return expense;
}

// DAO fires events (sync operations)
Future<void> upsertExpenseFromSync(
  ExpenseEntity expense,
  EventBroker eventBroker, // ‚úÖ Passed as parameter
) async {
  final existing = await getExpenseById(expense.id);
  if (existing == null) {
    await into(expenses).insert(...);
    eventBroker.fire(ExpenseCreated(expense)); ‚úÖ
  } else if (expense.updatedAt.isAfter(existing.updatedAt)) {
    await update(expenses).write(...);
    eventBroker.fire(ExpenseUpdated(expense)); ‚úÖ
  }
}
```

  - [ ] Verify < 1 second realtime sync latency
  - [ ] Multi-device testing

**Expected Outcome:**
- ‚úÖ Events fire for BOTH local and remote changes
- ‚úÖ Architecture supports event-driven UI
- ‚è≥ Manual device testing deferred to later

---

### ‚è≥ Phase 2.4: Event-Driven Providers - IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Create computed providers that react to events for reactive UI

**Current Architecture Status:**
- ‚úÖ UI already calls Use Cases directly (no Notifiers needed!)
- ‚úÖ Stream providers exist for queries (`allExpenses`, `userGroups`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Events fire for both local and remote changes
- ‚è≥ Need: Computed providers that recalculate when events fire

**Tasks:**

**1. Event-Driven Computed Providers** (Primary Focus)
- [ ] **Group Statistics Providers**
  - [ ] `groupTotalProvider(groupId)` - Sum of expenses, reacts to ExpenseCreated/Updated/Deleted
  - [ ] `groupExpenseCountProvider(groupId)` - Number of expenses per group
  - [ ] `groupBalanceProvider(groupId)` - Per-member balances (future)

- [ ] **Dashboard Providers**
  - [ ] `dashboardStatsProvider` - Aggregate stats across all groups
  - [ ] `recentActivityProvider` - Recent 10 changes (expenses/groups)
  - [ ] `totalSpendingProvider` - Total across all groups

- [ ] **Optional: Activity Feed**
  - [ ] `activityFeedProvider` - Stream of all events for activity log
  - [ ] `groupActivityProvider(groupId)` - Activity stream per group

**2. UI Enhancements**
- [ ] **Validation Error Display**
  - [ ] Show validation errors from Use Cases in snackbars
  - [ ] Form field error states
  - [ ] Improve error messages

- [ ] **Loading & Success States**
  - [ ] Loading indicators during operations
  - [ ] Success feedback (snackbars, animations)
  - [ ] Optimistic UI updates

**3. Testing & Verification**
- [ ] **Reactive Behavior**
  - [ ] Test providers update when events fire
  - [ ] Test multiple screens update simultaneously
  - [ ] Verify no duplicate calculations

- [ ] **Performance**
  - [ ] Profile event overhead (target: < 1ms per event)
  - [ ] Check for memory leaks in providers
  - [ ] Ensure efficient event filtering

**Implementation Pattern:**
```dart
// Event-driven computed provider
@riverpod
Stream<double> groupTotal(Ref ref, String groupId) async* {
  // Initial value
  final expenses = await ref.watch(
    expensesByGroupProvider(groupId).future
  );
  yield expenses.fold(0.0, (sum, e) => sum + e.amount);

  // React to events
  final eventBroker = ref.watch(eventBrokerProvider);
  await for (final event in eventBroker.stream) {
    // Only recalculate if event affects this group
    if (event is ExpenseEvent && event.expense.groupId == groupId) {
      final newExpenses = await ref.read(
        expensesByGroupProvider(groupId).future
      );
      yield newExpenses.fold(0.0, (sum, e) => sum + e.amount);
    }
  }
}

// Alternative: FutureProvider with auto-refresh
@riverpod
Future<double> groupTotalAlt(Ref ref, String groupId) async {
  // Listen to events to trigger refresh
  ref.listen(
    expenseEventStreamProvider,
    (prev, next) {
      if (next.expense.groupId == groupId) {
        ref.invalidateSelf(); // Trigger recalculation
      }
    },
  );

  final expenses = await ref.watch(
    expensesByGroupProvider(groupId).future
  );
  return expenses.fold(0.0, (sum, e) => sum + e.amount);
}
```

**Architecture Notes:**
- ‚úÖ No Notifiers needed - UI already uses Use Cases correctly
- ‚úÖ Stream providers for queries remain unchanged
- ‚úÖ Computed providers layer on top via events
- ‚úÖ Events provide decoupling between data changes and UI updates

**Next Steps:**
1. Survey existing UI screens to identify needed computed values
2. Implement `groupTotalProvider` as proof of concept
3. Add dashboard providers for statistics
4. Enhance UI feedback for operations

## Architecture Principles (v2.2)

### Clean Architecture Layers

**Domain Layer** (`lib/features/*/domain/`)
- Pure business logic (entities, repositories, use cases)
- No dependencies on infrastructure
- Repository interfaces only

**Data Layer** (`lib/features/*/data/`)
- Repository implementations
- DAOs and data sources
- Firestore services
- Handles sync and events

**Presentation Layer** (`lib/features/*/presentation/`)
- UI components (screens, widgets)
- State management (Riverpod providers)
- Calls Use Cases, never repositories directly

**Core Layer** (`lib/core/`)
- Shared utilities (events, logging, database)
- Cross-cutting concerns

### Error Handling Pattern

**Use Cases:**
- Handle ALL validation and error wrapping
- Return `Result<T>` (Success or Failure)
- Wrap repository calls in try-catch blocks
- Provide logging via inherited `LoggerMixin`

**Repositories:**
- Focus solely on data operations
- Throw exceptions directly (no Result wrapping)
- Fire events after successful operations
- Maintain atomic transactions

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Single Responsibility: Repositories do data, Use Cases handle business logic
- ‚úÖ Clean Interfaces: Simple return types, no Result wrapping in repos
- ‚úÖ Consistent Error Handling: All errors flow through Use Cases uniformly

### Event-Driven Architecture

**Events:**
- Fired by repositories after successful operations
- Broadcast via singleton `EventBroker`
- Used for reactive UI updates
- Fire for BOTH local and remote changes

**Providers:**
- Can react to events for real-time updates
- Multiple providers can listen to same events
- Event-driven state management

---

## Development Guidelines

### Standard Pattern for All Features

```dart
// 1. Create Use Case
class CreateFeatureUseCase extends UseCase<Input, Output> {
  final FeatureRepository _repository;

  CreateFeatureUseCase(this._repository);

  @override
  Future<Result<Output>> call(Input input) async {
    log.d('Creating feature: $input');

    // Validation
    if (input.isInvalid) {
      return Failure(Exception('Invalid input'));
    }

    // Execute and handle errors
    try {
      final result = await _repository.createFeature(input);
      return Success(result);
    } catch (e) {
      log.e('Error creating feature: $e');
      return Failure(Exception('Failed to create feature'));
    }
  }
}

// 2. Repository fires event
class SyncedFeatureRepository implements FeatureRepository {
  final AppDatabase _database;
  final EventBroker _eventBroker;

  @override
  Future<Output> createFeature(Input input) async {
    await _database.transaction(() async {
      await _database.featureDao.insert(input);
      await _database.syncDao.enqueueOperation(...);
    });

    _eventBroker.fire(FeatureCreated(result));
    return result; // Throws on error
  }
}

// 3. Provider calls Use Case
class FeatureNotifier extends _$FeatureNotifier {
  Future<void> createFeature(Input input) async {
    state = const AsyncLoading();

    final useCase = ref.read(createFeatureUseCaseProvider);
    final result = await useCase.call(input);

    result.fold(
      (_) => state = const AsyncData(null),
      (error) => state = AsyncError(error, StackTrace.current),
    );
  }
}
```

### Code Style
- ‚úÖ One class per file (SRP)
- ‚úÖ No barrel files (direct imports)
- ‚úÖ Extensions stay with base class
- ‚úÖ Concise comments (code should be self-documenting)
- ‚úÖ LoggerMixin for logging in Use Cases and Repositories
