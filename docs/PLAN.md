# FairShare Development Plan

**Philosophy**: Build minimally, test thoroughly, iterate quickly.

## Current Status: Phase 2.2 Complete ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ
- [x] Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In
- [x] Offline-first database (Drift/SQLite)
- [x] Basic routing and navigation
- [x] Sign-out risk assessment
- [x] UI foundation (screens, theme, navigation)

### Phase 2.1 & 2.2: Core Functionality ‚úÖ
- [x] Expense creation and tracking
- [x] Personal groups (auto-created)
- [x] Shared groups (create & join)
- [x] Firebase sync with upload queue
- [x] Schema v5 refactoring (unified model)
- [x] Soft delete support
- [x] Foreign key constraints

## Phase 2: Minimal Working App üéØ

**Goal**: End-to-end functionality with simplest possible implementation. User can track expenses, see balances, and sync to cloud.

### 2.1 Expenses - Core Flow ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Priority**: Critical - This is the heart of the app

- [x] **Create expense and save to local DB**
  - Wire up CreateExpenseScreen form to database
  - Save with current user as payer
  - Default to "Personal" group (auto-created)
  - Equal split only (simplest case)

- [x] **Display expense list**
  - Replace empty state in ExpensesTab with ListView
  - Show: title, amount, date, payer
  - Sort by date (newest first)
  - Pull from local database

- [x] **Expense domain layer**
  - Create ExpenseEntity (pure data model with Freezed)
  - Create ExpenseRepository interface
  - Implement LocalExpenseRepository (Drift)
  - Add ExpenseFormatter helper for display logic

### 2.2 Groups - Basic Support ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Priority**: High - Needed for multi-user scenarios

- [x] **Auto-create "Personal" group**
  - Create on first sign-in + app startup
  - Single member (current user)
  - Use for ungrouped expenses

- [x] **Manual group creation**
  - GroupNotifier with createGroup method
  - Save to local database with 6-digit ID
  - Current user as sole member initially

- [x] **Display group list**
  - Replace empty state in GroupsTab
  - Show: name, tap for details (placeholder)
  - Stream updates from database

- [x] **Group domain layer**
  - Create GroupEntity (pure data model)
  - Create GroupMemberEntity
  - Create GroupRepository interface
  - Implement LocalGroupRepository
  - Add GroupInitializationService

**Key Learnings**:
- Fixed provider lifecycle with `@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)` for repositories
- Fixed auth provider to use synchronous `getCurrentUser()` method

### 2.3 Balances - Simple Calculation
**Priority**: High - Core value proposition

- [ ] **Calculate balances for a group**
  - Algorithm: Sum expenses per person
  - Show who paid what
  - Show who owes what
  - Simple list format: "Alice owes Bob $25"

- [ ] **Display in BalancesTab**
  - Replace empty state
  - Select group (dropdown)
  - Show calculated balances
  - "All settled up" when balanced

### 2.4 Firebase Sync - Basic Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Priority**: Medium - Can work offline for now

- [x] **Sync expenses to Firestore**
  - Push unsynced expenses on connectivity
  - Upload queue system (Option D from sync strategy)
  - Handle simple errors (retry later)
  - All expenses sync (including personal for backup)

- [x] **Sync groups to Firestore**
  - Push unsynced groups
  - Personal groups stay local (metadata only)
  - Basic conflict: last write wins

- [x] **Pull changes from Firestore**
  - Fetch on app start (if connected)
  - Simple merge: newer timestamp wins

- [ ] **Sync status indicator** (UI not yet implemented)
  - Show sync icon in app bar
  - Display unsynced count
  - Manual "Sync Now" button

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Upload queue table tracks pending operations
- Personal groups: `isPersonal: true` ‚Üí metadata stays local, expenses sync
- Shared groups: `isPersonal: false` ‚Üí everything syncs
- Repositories check `isPersonal` before enqueueing operations
- Firestore services handle upload/download with proper checks

## Phase 3: Multi-User & Collaboration

**Goal**: Share groups with others, see their expenses

- [ ] Group invitations (share code or link)
- [ ] Accept/decline invitations
- [ ] Add members to existing groups
- [ ] See expenses created by other members
- [ ] Real-time sync with conflict resolution

## Phase 4: Enhanced UX

**Goal**: Make the app delightful to use

- [ ] Expense categories with icons
- [ ] Custom split options (percentage, exact amounts)
- [ ] Edit/delete expenses
- [ ] Expense detail screen with history
- [ ] Search and filter expenses
- [ ] Date range selection
- [ ] Receipt photo attachment

## Phase 5: Settlement & Payments

**Goal**: Help users settle debts efficiently

- [ ] Optimize settlements (minimize transactions)
- [ ] Mark settlements as paid
- [ ] Settlement history
- [ ] Payment reminders
- [ ] Settlement suggestions

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

**Goal**: Power user features

- [ ] Multi-currency support with conversion
- [ ] Recurring expenses
- [ ] Expense templates
- [ ] Data export (CSV, PDF)
- [ ] Expense reports and analytics
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Widgets for quick expense entry

## Technical Debt & Improvements

**Address as needed throughout development**

- [ ] Add unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Add widget tests for key screens
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add analytics/crash reporting
- [ ] Performance optimization (lazy loading, pagination)
- [ ] Accessibility improvements (screen readers, font scaling)
- [ ] Localization (i18n)
- [ ] Onboarding flow for new users
- [ ] App icon and splash screen

## Non-Goals (For Now)

Things we're explicitly NOT doing yet:

- ‚ùå Complex split algorithms (by income, by consumption)
- ‚ùå Integration with payment platforms (Venmo, PayPal)
- ‚ùå AI-powered expense categorization
- ‚ùå Receipt OCR/scanning
- ‚ùå Web app or desktop versions
- ‚ùå Social features (comments, likes, activity feed)
- ‚ùå Gamification
- ‚ùå Premium/subscription tiers

## Success Metrics (Phase 2)

How we know Phase 2 is complete:

1. ‚úÖ User can create an expense and see it in the list
2. ‚úÖ User can create a group
3. ‚è≥ User can see balances for a group (schema ready, calculation pending)
4. ‚úÖ Expenses sync to Firebase when online
5. ‚úÖ App works completely offline
6. ‚úÖ No crashes in basic flow
7. ‚úÖ Can sign out and sign back in without data loss

**Status**: 6 of 7 complete. Only balance calculations remain for Phase 2 completion.

## Recent Accomplishments (2025-10-01)

### Major Schema Refactoring ‚úÖ
- **Removed denormalized data**: Deleted `User.groupIds`, made `group_members` single source of truth
- **Unified expense model**: Deleted `PersonalExpenseEntity`, use `ExpenseEntity` with `isPersonal` groups
- **Added soft deletes**: `deletedAt` on groups and expenses with restore capability
- **Foreign key constraints**: CASCADE deletes for data integrity
- **Balance tracking**: Created `GroupBalanceEntity` and table (calculation service pending)
- **Schema migration**: v4 ‚Üí v5 with all queries updated

### Alignment Fixes ‚úÖ
- Fixed personal group initialization to set `isPersonal: true`
- Fixed UI group creation to explicitly set `isPersonal: false`
- Fixed all repository methods to check `isPersonal` before enqueueing
- Added soft delete filtering to all database queries
- Updated Firestore upload methods with `isPersonalGroup` parameter

### Documentation ‚úÖ
- Created comprehensive schema documentation
- Organized all docs into `docs/` folder
- Removed redundant/historical files

## Next Immediate Actions

**Start here** üëá

### Phase 2.3 - Balance Calculations
1. Implement balance calculation service
2. Update balances when expenses change
3. Display balances in BalancesTab
4. Add sync for balance data

### Optional Improvements
- Add sync status indicator UI
- Implement soft delete UI (undo functionality)
- Fix profile screen null-safety warnings
- Add unit tests for new schema

**One feature at a time. Make it work, then make it better.**
